# Destiny 2 Vendors Armor Rolls bot
## Purpose
The main purpose behind this is to, pratice and learn to use the Bungie.net API, learn to make better project organization, use other external API's and to make access to this info a little more simple

## Plans
The plan is:
- Get each vendors inventory by character
- Get each items stat values and total
- organize and record that information
- send this information to other sources
    - Initially the ideia is to make this a twitter bot to post the data there
    - Maybe in the future make it also a Discord bot

After the plan:
- Set it to run without my input
- Set it on a scheduled execution (chron-job ?)
- Make it create images with the info to share and post

## TODO
Currently, it does get all info from the api, now I have to:
- Organize all info
- Prepare for posting
    - "Classify" each roll
        - by that I mean, set some parameters so it would just post the "god rolls" that meet some requirements
- Post it

Outside of code, I need:
- Make the Readme Better
- Maybe one day make this repo public
- Comment code
