## Plans
The plan has been done! Now in my TODO section has some QoL changes I would like to make after, for now I will try to just make a simple saving system for local storage.

After the plan:
- Set it to run without my input
- Set it on a scheduled execution (chron-job ?)
- Make it create images with the info to share and post

## TODO
IT'S ALIVE! It does post on twitter and follow the thread type I had in mind!
Now what I need is some QoL changes:
- Currently it needs my input to authorize since I don't refresh the token
- Maybe save the info so I can catalog and analyse the data over time?
- Better code

Outside of code, I need:
- Make the Readme Better
- Maybe one day make this repo public
- Comment code
